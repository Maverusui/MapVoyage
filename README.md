# MapVoyage
- Map with weather and journey summary using LLM 
## Mapbox with Weather API and LangChain Project

## Features
- Integration with Mapbox API for mapping functionalities.
- Utilization of a weather API for retrieving weather data based on location.
- Integration with LangChain for text processing and Better analysis for a Journey.

## Tech Stack
- Mapbox API
- Weather API
- LangChain
- OpenAi

## Setup 

## Frontend
Start the frontend application -> open index.html and choose yor Start and End Destinations.

### Backend
1. Install dependencies:pip, venv, requests, json, dotenv
- Commands:
pip install virtualenv
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
pip install requests json5 python-dotenv

2. Create a virtual environment in Vscode or Pycharm for coding and a .env file for storing the secret api keys.

3. Open jsondata.py file and give destination inputs for .json file generation.

4. In weather.py a weather_data.json file will be generated by using weather api at all checkpoints from previously generated output.json files containing routes.

5. Upload the weather_data.json file in Google Colab and use the code given in llm_summary.ipynb to get a summaraized output from a Large Language Model.

## Project Structure
- `main.py`: Backend server code handling API requests and responses.
- `index.html` Frontend file of website using htmls, css and javascript.
- `llm_summary.ipynb`: Backend code for llm for Google Colab using OpenAI api and langchain.
-`.env_template`- contains a sample format for .env i.e environment variable to store secret API keys.
- `Project.txt`: Information about project flow and services.
- `Requirements.txt`: List of project dependencies.
- `ReadMe.md`: Documentation and instructions for the project.

- `ads.py`: Backend code for location inputs and route information.
- `jsondata.py`: Backend code for route json file i.e `output.json` file generation from API.
- `weather.py`: Backend code for weather information json file i.e `weather_data.json` file generation from API.
